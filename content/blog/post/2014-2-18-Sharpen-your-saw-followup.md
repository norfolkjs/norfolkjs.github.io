Here's a summary of the topics covered by the Monday Norfolk.js meetup:

Steve Hackbarth presented Sharpen your Saw, discussing problem-solving using Javascript and other useful utilities. Participants were encouraged to bring laptops to participate in code exercises.

<li> Participants could use <a href="https://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle.net</a></li>
<li>   Some of the utilities used were underscore.js and mocha.js tests.</li>

Two Exercises Discussed

<li>   Write a function that determines if a word is a left hand word. A left hand word is delimited by the divide between 'y h n' on the keyboard.</li>
<li>   Write a function that determines the longest word creatable with just left handed letters.</li>

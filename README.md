# Norfolk.js Website

This repository contains the source code for Norfolk.js's user group website. We strongly encourage everyone
to contribute as much or little as they wish. Not a developer? We can use documentation and design help as well!

This website is built using [jakyll](https://github.com/iambriansreed/jakyll) and TypeScript/Node alternative for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static website and blog generator. This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) on Github.
